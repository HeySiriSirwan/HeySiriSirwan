# Hi there, I'm Sirwan 

## About Me
I’m a **Data Analyst** passionate about turning data into insights that help make better decisions.
My main focus is on data analysis, but I also explore ml, data engineering, Linux system administration and software development.
I enjoy combining different technologies and skills in projects, experimenting with new tools, and seeing how everything can work together.

I consider myself a lifelong learner; i know there’s always more to learn, and i’m actively improving my knowledge in both practical projects and theoretical concepts.

## What I Do in GitHub
I maintain private repositories on GitHub for both business-related work and personal projects.
These repositories are not just for storing code, but also for version control, CI/CD automation, and workflow management. Through these, i experiment with new technologies, automate routine tasks, and keep my projects organized and reproducible.

## Skills & Technologies


### Core Skills:
**Python** for data analysis, machine learning, automation, and API development
**ML & Data Science** – building predictive models and analyzing data patterns
